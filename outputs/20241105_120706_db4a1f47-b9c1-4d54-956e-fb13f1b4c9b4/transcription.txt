 The lion jumped onto her and caught her throat in his strong jaws. That day he ate well. But the fox said, I see footprints of animals going into your den. None of them came out. I am very ill, said the cunning lion. I can't get up. I can't move my limbs. One day a clever fox came. The lion asked him to come closer. No other animal came to help the lion after that. He starved to death. He ran away yelling, You can't befool me. You can't eat me. Bye. One day a foolish goat came to ask about his health. A lion and a goat. A short story. He was old and weak. He could not hunt other animals. Once there was a lion in the forest.
